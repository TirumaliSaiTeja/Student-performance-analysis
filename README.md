# Student performance analysis 

**Overview**
This research offers a thorough examination of student performance indicators. To find insights into academic performance, it examines several variables, including test scores, preparation levels, and demographic information, using the students-cleandataset.csv dataset. The project uses machine learning models, statistical methods, and visuals to accurately assess and forecast student performance.

**Features**
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, standardized data, and ensured dataset readiness for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights and visualizations of trends in student performance.
Correlation Matrix: Identifies relationships between key performance indicators such as scores and preparation courses.
Predictive Modeling: Built and evaluated models to predict total and average scores.
Visualization Dashboards: Graphical representation of insights for easy interpretation.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes the following attributes:
gender: Gender of the student
lunch: Type of lunch received
test_preparation_course: Participation in preparation courses
math_score, reading_score, writing_score: Academic scores in core subjects
